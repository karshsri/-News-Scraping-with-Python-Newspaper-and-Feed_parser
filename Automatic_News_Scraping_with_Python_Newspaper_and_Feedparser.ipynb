            "This week's G7 summit in Canada will be dominated by war - only not one of those that the world leaders had expected. High on the agenda had been Russia's war against Ukraine and Donald Trump's tariff war against America's trading partners. Instead the three-day gathering in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta will inevitably be focused on war in the Middle East. Israel's decision to attack Iran will force the Group of Seven western powers to spend less time on other issues and instead discuss ways of managing the conflict. Like so many of their discussions, that will involve Britain, France, Germany and Italy - along with Canada and Japan - seeking to influence the United States. For although Israel might have launched these strikes without explicit American support, the US president is the only leader with real leverage over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Follow latest on Israel-Iran attacks\n",
            "\n",
            "What are the worst-case scenarios? The G7 leaders, due to arrive in Canada on Sunday, know the global security and economic risks if this conflict escalates, dragging in other countries, sending oil prices soaring. Yet they may struggle to achieve a common position. Some, such as UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and President Emmanuel Macron of France, have called for restraint and de-escalation. But others such as Japan's Prime Minister, Shigeru Ishiba, have condemned Israel's attack as \"intolerable\" and \"extremely regrettable\". For his part, Mr Trump praised Israel's strikes as \"excellent\".\n",

            "\n",
            "All this is a long way from what Mark Carney, the new Canadian Prime Minister, had planned for the talks in the wilderness retreat of Kananaskis. He wanted a summit to mark the G7's 50th birthday that avoided rows with Mr Trump. Much of his agenda was non-controversial, about energy security, protecting mineral supply chains, accelerating the digital transition and tackling forest fires. There was little mention of issues such as climate change, on which Mr Trump is a sceptic. Canadian officials even decided not to have a summit communique to avoid textual disputes dominating the gathering. Instead, world leaders will agree a number of \"short, action-oriented statements\" that maintain consensus and ignore divisive issues. Starmer heads to Canada for G7 Canadians well remember the last time they hosted a G7 gathering in 2018 when there was a row over - yes - Donald Trump's trade tariffs. The president stormed out early and, on the plane home, withdrew his support for the summit communique after watching Justin Trudeau, the then Canadian Prime Minister, give a press conference Mr Trump described as \"very dishonest and weak\". This summit Mr Carney may arrange a visit to Kananaskis golf club to try to keep Mr Trump onside.\n",

            "\n",
            "Beneath this caution lingers a fundamental question about whether these annual gatherings are still worth it, given Mr Trump's clear disdain. He prefers bilateral dealmaking to multilateral consensus-building. This is the president's first such foray onto the world stage since his inauguration and his six partners will be looking anxiously to see whether he wants to pick a fight - or look statesmanlike - for voters back home. Who's who in famous G7 photo from 2018 Max Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said: \"The question now is not so much 'is this an awkward family gathering?' That's almost a given. I think the question is: 'is this still a family?'\" In one respect, the dramatis personae in Kananaskis helps. There are several new faces around the table - Sir Keir Starmer, Chancellor Merz of Germany, Mr Ishiba and Mr Carney himself. The more veteran G7 leaders - President Macron and Prime Minister Meloni of Italy - get on well with the US president. Other leaders also attending the summit, from Mexico, India, Australia, South Africa, South Korea and Brazil, are not expected to pick a fight.\n",

            "The most obvious test of the G7's existential tensions will be Mr Trump's trade war. This club of some of the world's richest industrial nations was set up in the 1970s to discuss global economic crises. And yet now the G7 finds itself dealing with damaging tariffs imposed by one of its members. The argument world leaders will make to Mr Trump is that if he wants them to help him counter longer-term threats, economic or otherwise, from China, then it makes little sense for him to punish his allies. They will want to make explicit that there is a trade-off between putting America First and taking on Beijing. Josh Lipsky, senior director, Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, said: \"If the question is how we coordinate on China, how we coordinate on technology, how we coordinate on Russia and Ukraine - how can we have this kind of alliance between advanced-economy democracies if we're also creating economic hardship on our countries by something that's coming from another member?\"\n",

Sir Keir Starmer said he had accepted the recommendations of an audit by Baroness Louise Casey into the data and evidence on the nature and scale of group-based child sexual abuse. Baroness Casey has recommended a national inquiry is required, he said. The inquiry will cover England and Wales. For months, Sir Keir has faced criticism for not being willing to set one up.\n",

            "At the start of the year, the government dismissed calls for a national inquiry, arguing it had already been examined in a seven-year inquiry led by Professor Alexis Jay. But speaking to reporters on his way to the G7 summit, which begins in Canada tomorrow, the prime minister said: \"I've never said we should not look again at any issue.\" He added that Baroness Casey had originally thought a new inquiry was not necessary, but she had changed her mind having looked into it in recent months. \"She's come to the view there should be a national inquiry on the basis of what she's seen,\" Sir Keir said. \"I've read every single word of her report, and I'm going to accept her recommendation. \"I think that's the right thing to do, on the basis of what she has put in her audit. \"I asked her to do that job, to double-check on this. \"She's done that job for me, and having read her report… I shall now implement her recommendation.\" He added that it \"will take a bit of time\" to set up the inquiry, but added that \"it will be statutory under the Inquiries Act\". This means the inquiry will be able to compel witnesses to provide evidence. A senior government source said the inquiry would \"co-ordinate a series of targeted local investigations\". This will include new local investigations, which will take place even if local authorities don't want one. The local investigations will have the power to compel evidence to be given and witnesses to appear. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is expected to make a statement in the Commons on Monday, and Baroness Casey's report will be published alongside this.\n",

The demonstrations were held to counter a rare military parade hosted by Trump in Washington DC, and came after days of protests in Los Angeles and elsewhere over his immigration policies. Lawmakers, union leaders and activists gave speeches in cities including New York, Philadelphia and Houston to crowds waving American flags and placards critical of Trump. The military parade on Saturday evening, also Trump's birthday, was timed to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the US Army. He warned that any protests at the parade would be met with \"heavy force\".\n",

            "One of the larger crowds was in Los Angeles where leaders and law enforcement have been on high alert during days of protests, sometimes violent, against a series of deportation raids. Trump sent in the state's National Guard a week ago against the wishes of Governor Gavin Newsom and to the anger of local officials. On Saturday, Jose Azetcla, a member of the civil rights group the Brown Berets, told the BBC in Los Angeles that it was immigration that brought him out on to the streets. \"It's not harsh, it's evil. You don't separate families,\" he said.\n",

But a block or two away, hundreds of protesters continued marching peacefully. Despite the largest outpouring of protests since Trump was re-elected, opinion polls indicate his immigration policies remain broadly popular with the public. A CBS/YouGov survey last week found 54% of Americans approved of his policy to deport immigrants who are in the US illegally - 46% disapproved. A plurality of Americans (42%) said Trump's programme was making them safer and 53% said he was prioritising the deportation of dangerous criminals. The \"No Kings\" name of the protests refers to criticism that Trump has overstepped the limits of presidential power in his second term. The president stood to salute as some of the thousands of uniformed soldiers taking part in the parade marched past, alongside dozens of tanks and military vehicles, plus marching bands.\n",

The price tag is between $25m and $45m (£18.4m to £33.2m), according to the Army. But many of those attending told the BBC that for them it was about celebrating the military, to which some of them held a deep connection. When Melvin Graves returned from fighting in Vietnam, he got no parade, he said, so this was as close as he would come to one. Mr Graves acknowledged politics played a part in the event but added: \"This is about honouring these men and women who served, to thank them for their service.\"\n",

The numbers at Saturday's event was well below that, partly due to wet conditions and the forecast of heavy rain. For younger veterans, the parade was something they never saw during their time in service. Brian Angel, a former infantryman from Virginia who served in the Army between 2014 and 2017, including a stint at the border between South and North Korea, told the BBC he wanted to see more of this. \"Every branch should get some sort of parade or recognition.\"\n",

            "\n",
            "On the frozen frontline in the east of Zaporizhzhia, a Ukrainian soldier surveyed the fallout from a Russian assault. It was the middle of January 2024 and the ground was covered in ice. Two weeks earlier, an 18-strong Russian assault team had broken through the line and seized three positions, killing five Ukrainians and losing 10 Russians before ceding the thin stretch of land back to the Ukrainians just hours later. The three positions that had changed hands were each just a few foxholes in the ground –⁠ dots on a devastated landscape of craters and shredded trees. The Ukrainian soldier filmed as he looked over the remains of his fallen comrades. \"This is Vitas, the small one,\" he said, using the dead man's callsign. He examined another body. \"A silver ring, this is Grinch,\" he said. With difficulty, he turned over another frozen body. It was in bad condition, but the face was recognisable. The soldier sighed. \"What can I find to cover you, so that you won't get cold,\" he said to the dead man. He picked up a nearby helmet and placed it over the damaged face. \"We have found the Penguin,\" he said. A year later, in January 2025, a Russian soldier was frog-marched down the corridor of a rundown local courthouse in Zaporizhzhia flanked by five Ukrainian soldiers and a large rottweiler trained on the Russian's scent and straining at its leash to attack him. Dmitriy Kurashov, callsign 'Stalker', was about to go on trial for the alleged battlefield execution of Vitalii Hodniuk, a veteran 41-year-old Ukrainian soldier known by the callsign 'Penguin'.\n",
            "\n",
            "Handout Vitalii Hodniuk, a veteran Ukrainian soldier with the callsign 'Penguin', was killed on the frontline\n",
            "\n",
            "The trial was to be the first of its kind. According to Ukrainian authorities, Russian troops have executed at least 124 prisoners of war on the battlefield since the full-scale invasion began, but Kurashov is the first person to be brought to trial in Ukraine for the crime. His case is one of a tiny number among the tens of thousands of open war crimes cases where a suspect has been captured and can be made to stand in the dock. Adding to the unprecedented nature of the event, three members of Kurashov's own unit had agreed to testify against him. In the bright, boxy courtroom, Kurashov was locked in a glass-enclosed dock. Short in stature, his head often bowed, he cut a subdued figure. When he did look around, he was forced to swivel his head because he had lost one eye to a grenade at the front. It was not Kurashov's first time in the dock; he had been jailed twice before in Russia, and was among the thousands of prisoners freed by the state to take part in the war. The prosecutor read the charges. Kurashov was accused of shooting Hodniuk execution style as the Ukrainian soldier attempted to surrender – a violation of the laws of war. Kurashov had intially pleaded not guilty, during the pre-trial phase, but now in court he switched his plea to guilty. Informally, he maintained his innocence, and was making the switch purely to speed up the process, he said. According to the UN, battlefield executions by Russians have increased at an alarming rate over the past year. In a February report, the UN human rights mission in Ukraine said it had found evidence of 79 executions by Russian forces since August 2024, as well as evidence of three illegal killings by Ukraine using first-person drones. The UN also said it had found at least three calls by Russian public officials ordering or approving executions, and according to Ukraine there is evidence of Russian battlefield commanders ordering executions up and down the frontline.\n",

            "\n",
            "The assault on the front by Kurashov's unit was to be his first proper operation, just a few weeks after joining the war. The unit was part of \"Storm-V\", a detachment of the 127th motorised rifle division made up almost entirely of freed prisoners. The Storm-V units have been used by Russia as cannon fodder, sent to stage assaults on the worst parts of the frontline. They are a grim echo of similar units formed by Stalin, characterised principally by their extremely high rate of attrition. The operation began early on the morning of 6 January 2024 under a dense fog. The 18-strong Storm-V team approached the frontline in two armoured vehicles and a tank and the assault began. Kurashov was directed towards the small cluster of foxholes where Hodniuk and others were hiding, following a Russian artillery barrage. This is where Kurashov's account diverges from that of the prosecution and the Russian soldiers testifying against him. They say Kurashov called into a foxhole for those inside to surrender and Hodniuk emerged unarmed and kneeled on the ground, only for Kurashov to shoot him with a burst from his AK-47. Kurashov says that it was not him who fired the shots but another Russian, a medic with callsign \"Sedoy\", who was later killed. The Russians could not hold the position for long. Overpowered by Ukrainian forces just hours later, Kurashov and the other survivors crawled out of the foxholes and surrendered. They were marched away from the front to a Ukrainian armoured vehicle and taken as prisoners of war. Ukrainian soldiers who saw Hodniuk's body told the country's state security service, the SBU, that it lay face down with no weapon nearby.\n",

            "\n",
            "The SBU could not access the scene, because it was too close to the contact line, but the agency began what would become an extensive remote investigation. At an SBU location in Zaporizhzhia last month, the officer in charge – who spoke on condition of anonymity because of his work in the security service – drew a map of the scene and explained how they put Kurashov in the dock. \"The first step was interrogating the eight prisoners of war,\" he said. \"They were questioned as witnesses and later their identities were fully confirmed via social networks, mobile phones, and partial radio intercepts that preceded the event. The entire unit in that sector was tracked.\" Initially, there were two suspected executions. Another Ukrainian, callsign 'Grinch', had been beaten to death with a shovel, one witness said. But the SBU couldn't prove it. \"The polygraph didn't confirm the information and when the bodies were eventually recovered from the battlefield, none of them had such injuries,\" the investigator said. \"My opinion, after examining all the facts, is that this was made up.\" It was, he said, an example of Ukraine's ability to investigate and prosecute war crimes impartially, despite being the victim and under an ongoing state of war from the aggressor. \"Look, we have one suspect on trial for an execution,\" the SBU investigator said, referring to Kurashov. \"I signed it and sent it to court because we've gathered enough evidence that points to guilt. If our goal was simply to suspect anyone and send them to court we would have ten prisoners passing through every day.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "With no specialist war crimes court in Ukraine, the trial is uncharted territory for the three judges\n",
            "\n",
            "The seriousness with which Ukraine is treating this criminal prosecution is apparent. The SBU investigation produced more than 2,000 pages of evidence. Each of the witnesses was put through filmed reconstructions of the event on a Ukrainian army shooting range. In court, all efforts have been made by the prosecutor and the judges to ensure that Kurashov understands his rights, that he can understand his translator, and is given the opportunity to cross examine witnesses against him – an opportunity he has so far declined. (Kurashov's state-appointed lawyer declined to speak to the BBC. She has spoken only briefly in court, on administrative matters and to clarify some descriptions of the event by witnesses.) The three Russian witnesses all testified on the first day of Kurashov's trial – three former prisoners who like Kurashov had gambled on surviving the war to gain their freedom. One had been serving 25 years to life for killing two drug dealers, another nine years for grievous bodily harm for killing a man with a brick in a fight, a third eight years, also for grievous bodily harm.\n",
            "\n",
            "They gave evidence via video link from an adjacent courtroom, so they could be locked in their own dock. Dmitry Zuev, 44, was to be the key witness. He told the court that he saw Kurashov call for the Ukrainians to come out of the foxhole and surrender, after which Hodniuk emerged and knelt with his hands up. Then there were more gunshots and explosions, Zuev said, and he saw Hodniuk fall face down into the mud. Zuev also told the court that he personally knew the medic, Sedoy, who Kurashov has accused of the killing, and Sedoy was not there. Oleg Zamyatin, 54, testified that Hodniuk was not holding a gun when he emerged from the foxhole. Zamyatin did not see Kurashov fire the alleged shots, he said, because there were explosions at the same moment. \"But I can say that it was him,\" Zamyatin told the court. \"Because there was no one else at that spot except him.\" Konstantin Zelenin, 41, the commander of Kurashov's small assault group, told the court he was hiding in a crater when he saw Hodniuk exit the foxhole on the right side with his hands up. \"Then, just a split second later, as the shelling began again, I heard a burst from an automatic rifle,\" Zelenin said. \"On the right side was Stalker, and he was there alone.\"\n",

            "Kurashov told the BBC he was told \"not to take prisoners\"\n",
            "\n",
            "In the dock, Kurashov sat largely mute as his former unit mates testified against him, speaking only occasionally to his lawyer through a slim gap in the enclosure's door. It is not clear yet if he will testify on his own behalf. The day after one of his hearings, he agreed to talk to the BBC about how he had ended up on trial in Ukraine. The interview was co-ordinated by the SBU and conducted at a derelict building in Zaporizhzhia being used as a kind of safe house by the service, which confirmed the basic facts of Kurashov's life. Kurashov appeared in good condition and said he had agreed freely to take part. The lead judge in his case permitted the interview, for which an SBU press officer was present some of the time. Kurashov's remarks to the BBC will not be admissible in court. His journey to that miserable stretch of front where Hodniuk died – to becoming Stalker – began in an orphanage in Gremyachinsk, a decayed old coal town about a thousand miles from Moscow on the way to Siberia. Orphaned at birth, Kurashov was raised in a group home. As a teenager, he got into a fight with a police officer and was imprisoned for assault. He served four years, but on his release he had no family, friends or place to live, so he became a vagrant. He began robbing summer houses and shops for food and money, he said, resulting in another imprisonment, this time in a remote penal colony alongside men serving life sentences for the some of the most brutal crimes. Six months into that sentence, representatives from the Russian military came to the penal colony and told the convicts they had an opportunity to turn a new page in their lives. Kurashov still had five years to serve. \"They told us you can have a clean slate, become a clean person,\" he said. \"Just sign this contract and go.\" \"Go\" meant to the \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. Kurashov knew little about it, he said, but he thought anything was better than five more years in the penal colony or being turned out into the streets at the end of his sentence. So he signed, and was taken immediately to a training camp in occupied territory in Ukraine.\n",

            "\n",
            "Kurashov described his unit as made up entirely of \"people who had been pushed down by life and rejected by society, who were outside of society\". They were given 21 days training, he said, during which they were drunk almost all the time. \"They did not want to study or train,\" he recalled. \"They all said they were just there to die.\" There was no training on the Geneva Convention, to which Russia and Ukraine are both signatories, and which prohibits the killing of people who have surrendered or no longer pose a threat. In fact, the trainers told them the opposite, Kurashov said. \"The ones who taught us how to take positions told us not to take any prisoners,\" he said. His description matches accounts from his unit mates, who told Ukrainian investigators they were instructed to execute prisoners and throw grenades into dugouts even if the enemy had surrendered. It also matches accounts from other Russian prisoners of war. \"I don't recall training on international humanitarian law,\" a Russian POW told the UN recently. \"During our military training and later, commanders told us not to take [Ukrainian soldiers] as prisoners of war. It is logistically cumbersome.\" According to Kurashov, the unit were told they would be carrying out logistical operations like digging trenches, but instead found themselves headed immediately for battle. During the brief assault on the Ukrainian position, Kurashov's impression was not one of an able military unit at war. \"What I saw was people who just laid down and died,\" he said. Within hours, 10 of the 18-strong assault team were dead and the remaining eight were in captivity. Within a fortnight, the incident had become one of Ukraine's many thousands of war crimes cases. Ukraine has no specialist war crimes courts, so the cases generally fall to whichever court is local to the offence. In this case, the Zavodskyi District in Zaporizhzhia.\n",

            "Mykyta Manevskyi is prosecuting his first execution case\n",
            "\n",
            "Prior to the full scale invasion, 32-year-old Zavodskyi District prosecutor Mykyta Manevskyi had taken on a range of civil crimes like robbery, vandalism and fraud, plus two murder cases, but never a war crime. \"When you're working with an ordinary murder case, it has difficulties but it's pretty simple,\" Manevskyi said. \"You know where the murder took place, you can collect DNA and fingerprints, you can find the murder weapon. You have almost immediate access to the body. You can conduct forensic tests.\" In this case, Manevskyi's murder scene was on the contact line. \"We could not even extract the body for two months,\" he said. \"It made it difficult to perform any kind of forensic examination. The body was too long under the sun, the rain and snow, and it was harmed by artillery strikes.\" That made it difficult to ascertain anything concrete about the nature of the shots that killed Hodniuk. \"This is not the level of detail, unfortunately, that we need when investigating a murder,\" Manevskyi said. \"So we had to focus more on working with the witnesses we had.\" In fact, the prosecution is relying almost totally on the testimony of the Russian soldiers. There are no other eyewitnesses, no drone footage of the actual event and the physical evidence is circumstantial, much of it badly degraded by the battlefield conditions which persisted for weeks before the bodies could be recovered.\n",
            "\n",
            "War crimes are being tried at ordinary local courts like the Zavodskyi District Courthouse, where Kurashov's case is being heard\n",
            "\n",
            "But the testimony is not without its complications. The witnesses are all POWs, being held by the nation prosecuting the case. They were each interrogated up to 10 times by the Ukrainian state security service, during which time some of their stories evolved. One bore a grudge against Kurashov from their time together in training, he told investigators. Another said he resented the defendant for, in his view, getting them caught. \"It is a tricky area,\" said Sergey Vasiliev, a professor of international law at the Open University of the Netherlands. \"POWs are a particularly vulnerable category of witnesses, any evidence they give should be taken with a grain of salt.\" There was nothing inherently wrong with POWs testifying, Vasiliev said, but various factors could have affected their decision to appear for the prosecution. \"Maybe they are expecting better treatment in Ukrainian custody, maybe they expect to be prioritised in a prisoner swap,\" he said. \"They could have various incentives to lie.\" Kurashov maintains his story about the medic, Sedoy. He told the BBC he had pleaded guilty because he believed the sooner the trial was over the sooner he could be exchanged back to Russia. But if Kurashov is found guilty, he is no longer a prisoner of war. He is simply a prisoner in Ukraine's civil legal system. Yuriy Belousov, the head of the war crimes department of Ukraine's Office of the Prosecutor General, told the BBC that Russian soldiers convicted of war crimes would go to prison in Ukraine and stay there. \"We prosecute on behalf of the victims and their relatives and they should feel justice has been done,\" Belousov said. In the end, it may not be that simple. Russia has captured many thousands of civilians during its full scale invasion of Ukraine and is effectively holding them hostage in Russian prisons. If the Kremlin decides it wants Kurashov back, it may have leverage to get him. \"That is less of a legal and more of an ethical issue,\" Belousov said. \"If, let's say, 100 people would be offered to exchange for this one, then yes maybe. It is our obligation to prosecute on behalf of victims, but it is also our obligation to save our people who have been kept in Russia.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Three of Dmitriy Kurashov's former unit mates testified against him\n",
            "\n",
            "Belousov and his colleagues are aiming at bigger fish than Kurashov. Their goal for this year and next is to bring cases against middle and higher level Russian command, he said. According to the testimony from the captured Russians in Kurashov's unit, their senior commander issued an order directly before the assault that no prisoners should be taken. According to Belousov, similar evidence has been found up and down the frontline. Grim video evidence, sometimes shared on Russian social media, appears to bear that out. Russia has in turn accused Ukrainian troops of extra-judicial killings, and Ukraine has launched several investigations into its own forces (the exact number is unclear). But the number of allegations against Russia far outweighs that against Ukraine. Russia has previously denied committing war crimes in the conflict. The UN has also documented several cases of Russian public figures calling for executions. Last July, after Ukraine's Azov Brigade posted a social media video showing one of its members shooting a Russian soldier in a dugout, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, called for \"total executions\" of Ukrainian servicemen. \"No words about mercy. No humanity. No pardon. They have no right to life. Execute, execute and execute,\" Medvedev wrote on the Telegram social media platform. Medvedev's words will not cost him anything. Instead they run downhill until they reach the level of Vitalii Hodniuk, Dmitry Kurashov, and all the other Russian and Ukrainian men killing each other in service of the war's obscure goals. In this case, one of those men stands accused of breaking the laws of the killing he had been sent to do – laws he may well have been ordered to disregard. If found guilty, Kurashov faces up to life in prison. At the end of his conversation with the BBC, he said that he had no real vision for the future, other than a desire to return to Russia. \"At least I will have a disability,\" he said, referring to the loss of his eye, and the anticipated benefits it would draw. \"I won't have to be a vagrant anymore.\" Vitalii Hodniuk cannot return home, of course. It was two months before his body could even be recovered. His family did not want to speak publicly about his passing, but they did assist in the SBU in its investigation. Hodniuk's record shows that he was an experienced soldier who defended Ukraine against Russian-backed forces from 2015 to 2020 and joined up to fight again in 2022. Last May, six months after he died, the Penguin was brought back to his village to be buried. On a bright morning, just a stone's throw from where he grew up and went to school, people lined the street on their knees to watch his coffin pass by. Kurashov's trial continues.\n",

Melissa Hortman, 55, a Democrat, and her husband were killed in Brooklyn Park, a city near Minneapolis. John Hoffman, 60, also a Democrat, and his wife were shot several times at their home about 15km (nine miles) away in a related attack. He is out of surgery and stable. A search is on for the suspect who police say was impersonating an officer. He has been named as Vance Luther Boelter, 57 and there is a $50,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.\n",

            "He served on the state's workforce development board with Hoffman, a state senator, but officials are still investigating whether he knew either politician. Police said he tricked his way into the victims' homes using a false badge and uniform and was even driving a car that looks like a police vehicle equipped with emergency lights. The first emergency call was made at 02:00 local time regarding the incident involving state senator Hoffman and his wife. Then another call was placed to police at 03:35, which led officers to check on House Speaker Hortman. The police exchanged gunfire with the suspect at Hortman's home, but he managed to escape. Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said police are engaged in an \"extensive manhunt\" alongside the FBI, SWAT and hundreds of police officers. He said police took the suspect's car and believe he is travelling on foot. Authorities are warning people in the area not to answer their door for a police officer unless there are two officers together.\n",

In a statement, Trump said \"such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America,\" and authorities would be \"prosecuting anyone involved to the fullest extent of the law\". Bob Jacobson, the state's commissioner of public safety, said public servants have been \"targeted in a violent and cowardly way\". Saturday was a \"dark day\" for Minnesota, but \"we will not allow fear or violence to define who we are or how we move forward\", he said. Walz activated the State Emergency Operations Center - used for managing disasters or emergencies - in response to the shootings. The governor said Minnesota had lost a \"great leader and I lost the dearest of friends\". He called Hortman \"a formidable public servant, a fixture and a giant in Minnesota\", saying \"she woke up every day determined to make the state a better place\".\n",

            "Listen to this article on BBC Sounds We are driving at speed through the green hills of rural Hertfordshire. Through the passenger seat window, large elegant houses flash by. Each front lawn is neat, each hedgerow well-kept. It looks like England from a storybook - but this part of the country is actually on the frontline of a relatively new (and some might say divisive) approach to crime prevention. In the driver's seat is Robert, a guard employed by Blueline Security. His car is painted with blue and yellow stripes, meaning it looks a lot like a police car. Inside there's a walkie-talkie, a first-aid kit, and a Belgian Malinois dog called Bella (given similar training to a police dog, I'm told). But Robert - who wears a bullet-proof vest and carries a pair of handcuffs - is careful to point out that he is not a real policeman. \"The more keen eye will realise that this isn't a police car,\" he says as he flicks his indicator. He points out that they follow the regulations on vehicle markings designed to distinguish police cars from other cars. \"But it looks similar enough where criminality will see it at a distance and think, 'Let's maybe not go there'.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Luke Mintz/BBC Blueline is staffed by ex-police and army officers, including Robert (pictured)\n",
            "\n",
            "Blueline is one of a handful of \"private policing\" firms that have emerged in recent years. It has operated mostly in wealthy enclaves of southern England since 2019 and, for a fee, its team of ex-police or ex-army guards can patrol villages, looking for burglars and car thieves. Robert, in fact, spent 14 years working in the police force. Various similar businesses have sprung up around the UK in recent years, including My Local Bobby, which was founded in 2016 and now has almost 150 security guards, as well as a fleet of cars. According to some customers who spoke to the BBC, this fills a gap left by the real police, who they claim they no longer trust to turn up promptly to a 999 call in their villages. To residents who can afford these firms, they are a \"lifeline\", as one customer tells me. But to others, they represent an affront to the values on which British policing was founded; a step towards a country in which the wealthy get better access to law enforcement than the poor. One former senior figure in the Metropolitan Police says she fears the emergence of a \"two-tier society\". So, with pressures on real police growing, is there room for private firms to help ease the load - or do so-called \"private bobbies\" blur the lines between police and profit?\n",

            "Rise of 'private policing'\n",
            "\n",
            "The firms offering \"private policing\" that I've spoken to say that demand for their services has risen. According to a paper published last year by criminologists from the universities of Sheffield and Brunel, the UK's private security industry grew substantially between 2008 and 2021, with an increase in revenue and in the number of licensed security guards. And, according to the Home Office, the number of real police officers in England and Wales fell most years from 2009 onwards, reaching a low of about 122,000 in 2017 - before ticking back up, to about 147,000 last year.\n",
            "\n",
            "The study's co-author, Dr Matteo Pazzona, a Senior Lecturer in Economics at Brunel University, describes a shift in policing from the \"public to the private\" realm. Whilst most UK security guards work in shops and other businesses, his data does also signal a rise in the sort of residential work carried out by private firms, he says. There are lots of reasons why the security industry might have grown over this period. But David Spencer, a former Detective Chief Inspector at the Metropolitan Police, thinks that private firms could be filling the gaps left by police. \"If you've got money and you don't feel that the police are effective, then it's no surprise if you decide to use your resources to keep your family safe,\" he says.\n",

            "\n",
            "Until the 19th Century, protection from crime was largely a privilege enjoyed by the rich. Wealthy people employed \"thief takers\" to guard their property, whilst ordinary folk had to make do with volunteer watchmen, who focused on the more basic task of keeping order. That changed when Sir Robert Peel, a Tory prime minister, started London's Metropolitan Police - Britain's first modern, professional force funded from general taxation. He instilled in the force several principles that can still be reeled off from memory by many constables today: being visible in the community; treating members of the public equally, regardless of wealth or social standing - and perhaps more important than all: policing with trust. Now, some worry that trust is being undermined.\n",

            "Most burglaries and car thefts go unsolved. A YouGov survey from last month found that 50% of adults in Great Britain held \"not very much confidence\" or \"no confidence at all\" in their local force - up from 42% in 2019. The government's police inspector, Andy Cooke, said in a report in 2023 that confidence in police \"hangs by a thread\" (although his report last year noted some improvements). Mr Spencer, who is now head of crime and justice for the centre-right Policy Exchange think tank, says demands on police time have risen dramatically. Online fraud has shot up in recent decades, and police have recognised the need to tackle issues that were once considered \"private\" (like domestic abuse and sexual violence). And police resources are failing to keep up pace, he says. This, he thinks, helps explain the interest in so-called private police.\n",

She lives in rural Hertfordshire with her husband and one of her three children. She already had CCTV installed and, on the night that her neighbour was burgled, it showed a gang of masked men sitting on her garden chairs. \"You can see them looking at the camera, and they've seen it's zoomed in on them. And then they went.\" Her neighbours held a meeting; about 40 households decided to subscribe to a private firm. Each pays £1,500 per year. In return, guards patrol the area daily. Laura says she can call a guard at any time. \"I don't think we can afford to be confident that [the police] would get here in good time,\" she says. However, private guards have no more power than a member of the public. The aim for many is not to catch or restrain criminals but to act as a deterrent.\n",

But a spokesperson for the National Police Chiefs' Council says they remain \"resolutely committed\" to attending the scene of crimes, and that all English and Welsh police forces now aim to attend a property following every burglary report. They added that private firms \"should not replace or supplement police and it is for properly trained officers to intervene when a crime has been committed\".\n",

            "The question, though, is whether so-called private police firms signal the emergence of an unfair two-tier system, in which the wealthiest can pay to be better protected from crime. This is a concern for Parm Sandhu, a former chief superintendent at the Metropolitan Police who left the force in 2019 and has since written a book about her experiences of prejudice. \"If you're living on a council estate, you cannot afford to pay for policing,\" she says. \"Does that mean you deserve to be burgled, sexually assaulted, or mugged? No you don't.\" She argues that the correlation between falling police numbers and an expanding private security industry signals something \"totally wrong\". Andy, who also lives in rural Hertfordshire, near Laura, and employs a private security firm, has his own feelings on this. \"I look at it and say, 'It's £1,500 a year, I'm lucky I can find that,'\" he says. But he argues that not everyone who uses the service is wealthy. \"You watch the CCTV [of burglaries], you feel worried for your family.\" The expense, he adds, is worth it for that reason. Still, doubts remain.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ms Sandhu points out that the police-like appearance of some of these security firms could be confusing. \"If you've got somebody who's under the influence [of] drugs or alcohol, they will look up quickly and think, 'Oh, this is a police officer',\" she says. \"It's really important to have that differential between police officers and security guards. \"Members of the public [could] go to them thinking they're talking to police officers, and take their advice.\" Which raises the question of what, exactly, private guards can do. The companies I speak to are clear that their staff can restrain somebody they suspect to be a criminal, only in the same way that any member of the public can, a power commonly known as a \"citizen's arrest\". And it comes with risk. Under English and Welsh law, a citizen's arrest can only be used for an \"indictable\" offence - a serious crime tried at the Crown Court. You cannot use a citizen's arrest for a lesser \"summary\" offence (tried at the magistrates' court). In the heat of the moment, it may be difficult for a guard to judge the difference - and if they get it wrong, they could be guilty of a crime themselves.\n",

            "There are also questions about accountability. Police forces are inspected by the Government's Inspectorate of Constabulary; if a serious complaint is made against a constable, it will be investigated by an independent regulator. Few such tools of accountability exist for private firms - other than having their licence revoked by the Security Industry Authority. But Martin Gill, a criminology professor and the director of Perpetuity Research, a security consultancy, points out that in shopping centres and hospitals, the \"majority of policing is undertaken by private police forces\" (in other words, security guards). Most of them, he argues, do a \"very good job\". In his view, when a private firm starts operating in a residential area, the local police force should engage.\n",

He would like police to work closer with firms. \"At the moment, there's a reticence still within policing to sharing information [and] intelligence. Often that information is absolutely vital for us to do our job.\" The College of Policing has said police forces should only share intelligence under strict circumstances.\n",

            "Ultimately, the sort of work carried out by 'private bobbies' is a tiny fraction of the real police work carried out across the country. But whether more residential communities will in future opt for the private model depends largely on whether the police are able to restore public confidence, says Mr Spencer of Policy Exchange. \"If it doesn't, then I think it's inevitable we will see more people […] turning to private providers,\" he says. Back on the road with Robert, midway through his patrol, his radio buzzes. A customer has called: a horse is loose and wandering in a country lane. Within minutes, he has driven there and helped return it to its field. It's not quite Starsky & Hutch, Robert concedes, but it's an insight into the sort of work they do. And yet, he admits, there are limits. He recalls one shift, on an April night this year, when he drove along a country road in his patch and saw a car that looked like it was being used for drug dealing. \"If they've had drugs and they're behind a wheel, that's a summary offence - I have no power to deal with it,\" he says. Instead, he sat in his car and called the real police. Top image credit: Getty Images\n",

            "\n",
            "The anointment of Sir David Beckham is a moment of establishment recognition three decades in the making. But as the former footballer was conferred his knighthood on Friday, reports of family drama threatened to overshadow the milestone. Known for his precision on and off the pitch, Sir David has spent decades carefully curating his family's public image. This year is one of celebration for the former England captain - turning 50 at the helm of an estimated £500m empire. But for the past few weeks, much of the online interest around the Beckhams has focused on reports that eldest son Brooklyn and his wife Nicola Peltz have fallen out with the rest of the family. An expert in reputation management says reports of the feud have begun to affect the family's public image, noting press coverage of the Beckhams has taken on a more soap-opera-like tone. Celebrity crisis PR Lauren Beeching says recent media conversation has \"started to feel more like something you'd see around a reality TV family\".\n",

            "Getty Images German Glamour magazine called Brooklyn and Nicola the \"world's most talked about couple\" earlier in June\n",
            "\n",
            "Reports of a family fallout began three years ago as stories emerged claiming that Nicola had refused to wear one of Victoria Beckham's designs on her wedding day. Nicola later said she had wanted to, telling the Times Victoria had realised her atelier could not make it in time so she had had to pick a different designer. Nicola denied there was a feud in the family. But scrutiny continued, with shows of unity (from warm social media posts to shared events) being framed as the Beckhams putting the feud behind them, or discouraging rumours of discord. Eventually, speculation seemed to die down. But reports of a rift returned last month after Brooklyn, 26, and Nicola, 30, were absent from David Beckham's 50th birthday celebrations and did not post a birthday message online. A source told the BBC Brooklyn had chosen not to go to the party as his younger brother Romeo was attending with a woman Brooklyn had previously been linked to. The source added that this woman's invitation had been a \"big source of further tension\". Sir David and Lady Beckham have never acknowledged the rumoured rift, and have not responded to the BBC's requests for comment. Ms Beeching believes there is now a risk the feud stories could start to shape the family's image \"instead of the achievements they actually want to be known for\". \"Once you start being spoken about like a reality TV family,\" she continues, \"that reputation starts to slip.\"\n",

            "As Manchester United's golden boy, David Beckham quickly transcended football to become a global celebrity. He and Spice Girl wife Victoria created Brand Beckham - fusing fame, fashion and football to redefine modern stardom. \"Their brand has always been about control of narrative, image, and legacy,\" says Mr Borkowski. \"The media didn't chase them. They gave it a trail to follow - blending scandal with strategy and high-end deals.\" Beckham \"made metrosexuality mainstream\", he adds. \"He showed working-class lads you could wear nail polish, model for Armani, champion grooming rituals - and still bend a free kick past the keeper at crunch time. All while embodying a very traditional ideal: devoted husband, hands-on dad, family first.\" \"I lived my career through the spotlight,\" Sir David told BBC Radio 4's Front Row in 2013. \"You have to be a certain person, you have to create a certain person, and you have to be yourself.\" These parallel identities - carefully constructed yet authentic - gave Beckham his unique pull. While the Beckham family have always been relatively private, Ms Beeching sees David's 2023 Netflix documentary as a turning point in how the public perceived them. \"The Beckham brand has always been seen as aspirational, not accessible, but since the documentary, there's been a notable increase in how much the family share on their social media accounts, which puts them closer to being reality stars,\" she says. Ms Beeching says recent news has pulled the family \"away from legacy-building and into soap opera territory, which was never their lane\". The constant rumours about the family's dynamic have led some fans to take on a \"Sherlock Holmes role\" - so now, every absence in a photo becomes a hidden theory and every Instagram caption has a sub context.\n",

            "Matt Navarra, a social media consultant, tells the BBC fans expect to see social signals of closeness such as mutual follows, birthday posts and supportive comments. \"When these signals are missing, people don't assume neutrality, they assume tension.\" Fans and tabloids were quick to pick up on Brooklyn and Nicola's German Glamour magazine shoot earlier this month as a signal that the rift was far from over - the couple avoided mentioning the Beckhams, but Nicola's love for her own family was referenced several times. Since then, every Beckham Instagram post and like (or lack thereof) has been agonised over, and even if discussion of the feud are eventually put to bed, it is unlikely that social media sleuthing will end. Mr Navarra explains that even if facts are revealed and the rift rumours are quashed, \"the social media algorithm doesn't care about accuracy - it cares about engagement\". This feud is the \"perfect storm as it's built to go viral\", and social media does not just fuel speculation, it manufactures and rewards it, he says. Of course, family drama is also more relatable than a knighthood, and there has always been an insatiable appetite for famous families feuding in the spotlight. Ms Beeching sees parallels between the Beckham family fallout and the rift between the Sussexes and the Royal Family, which continues to make headlines.\n",

            "\"The Royal Family lost control over the narrative as Harry and Meghan became more independent, and that's the same here with Brooklyn and Nicola, who are both adults and are forming their own public personas,\" she says. Like Meghan, Nicola Peltz was already a known figure before marrying Brooklyn. The daughter of a billionaire businessman and model, \"Nicola doesn't need to rely on the Beckhams for money or fame\", says Wayne Barton, who wrote a biography about Beckham in 2020. In a bid to not be perceived as nepo babies - children of celebrities who get fast-tracked to success - \"Brooklyn and Nicola are in search of their own identities, which \"may be putting them at odds with the careful public image that the Beckhams have created for the family\", he says.\n",

            "Sir David's polished image has, on occasion, been tarnished by scandal - in 2003, he faced accusations of an extra-marital affair with his former personal assistant Rebecca Loos. Nicole Lampert, the Daily Mail's showbiz editor at the time, says the Beckhams perfected \"smiling through\" issues - letting actions speak over words. In 2004, the couple staged a photocall skiing together to demonstrate a united front - with Victoria giving what Lampert describes as a pained \"rictus grin\". Generally, however, the Beckhams have remained tight-lipped when it comes to scandals, such as criticism over David Beckham's involvement with Qatar, and leaked emails in 2017 that included disparaging comments about singer Katherine Jenkins being awarded an honour over him.\n",

My daughter clearly needed support and my wife was noticeably struggling and exhausted.\" A few weeks after Kiara was born, Jamie's mother-in-law flew from Zimbabwe to support the family, because Jamie was only entitled to statutory paternity leave. Rules in the UK allow new fathers and second parents in full-time employment to take up to two weeks off work. That applies to all partners, regardless of gender, after the birth, surrogacy or adoption of a baby, but not those who are self-employed or dads earning less than £123 a week. Those eligible receive £187.18 a week, or 90% of their average earnings, whichever is lower. This works out as less than half of the National Living Wage. Jamie, from Ashford in Kent, says the statutory pay \"was frankly pennies\". He and his partner are now expecting their second child, in August - something they began saving for before Jamie's wife Zanele even fell pregnant. Jamie says his \"frustration\" about paternity pay led him to attend the world's first \"dad strike\" earlier this week, when fathers from across the country protested outside the government's Department for Business and Trade in Westminster. \"Seeing things change relatively recently in other countries... why are we not keeping up?\" Jamie says.\n",

            "For Octavio, spending four months at home with his daughter Alicia has made \"a tremendous difference\". He split his paternity leave into two parts - six weeks - which was mandatory -immediately after Alicia was born, and the remaining 10 weeks when his wife went back to work. \"The extended quality time with Alicia allowed us to develop a strong bond that I believe wouldn't have formed as deeply otherwise,\" says Octavio, a computer engineer from Seville. Over the past few years, Spain has increased the amount of time given to new fathers. In 2019, dads were entitled to five weeks off work. But from 2021, that was extended to 16 weeks at full pay, including for those who are self-employed. There is no cap on the salary paid. It means parental leave is now equal between mums and dads in Spain. \"These changes have truly made a significant difference,\" says Octavio.\n",

When his son Thibault was born five years ago, Antoine, who works full-time, was entitled to two weeks paternity leave. But in September 2020 paternity leave in France doubled, meaning Antoine got four weeks off work when his second child was born in 2023. \"It allowed me to support my wife and children,\" he says. \"Fathers should be allowed to be more present during these family life periods that enrich all relationships and allow them to fully take their place as full-time parents.\" France's paternity leave rules mean dads - including those who are self-employed - must take a week off work immediately after their child is born. Pay is covered by the employer for the first three days, but after that is state-funded. The remaining 21 days, which can be split into two chunks, are optional and can be taken anytime within the next six months. Pay is capped at €3,428 (£2,921) a month.\n",

After eleven weeks, the remaining 13 can be transferred to the birth partner if wanted, so they can use them as extra maternity leave. One of the parents can postpone up to 13 weeks of parental until their child is aged nine. André decided to split his parental leave - taking two weeks immediately after his baby Miro was born and saving the remaining 11 weeks - so he can look after his nine-month-old son when his partner returns to work. \"In Denmark, it's expected that the partner is more present,\" André says. \"You're not only connecting with your child, but you want to develop the family as a whole together.\"\n",

This is available to both parents, as long as they are employed, and is paid at 70% of a full-time salary. \"For many families, the 70% nine weeks is very low,\" Kamil says, \"but... when I took the leave my wife started going back to work. I earned 30% less, but she started earning more, so it was beneficial for our family.\" Kamil says those extra nine weeks alleviated a lot of \"stress\" as his wife transitioned back into work after a year off on maternity leave. \"I was confident,\" Kamil says. \"I felt as though I was doing a good job - and my daughter felt good with me.\"\n",

Mattias is able to take advantage of one of the most generous paternity leave policies in the world. Parents in Sweden, including those who are self-employed, can share up to 480 days of parent leave, with 90 days reserved specifically for each parent. Ringfencing time off for dads was first introduced in Sweden in 1995, with the introduction of a \"daddy month\" - 30 days just for fathers. This use-it-or-lose-it model increased to 60 days in 2002, and 90 days in 2016. The first 390 days for each parent are paid at 80% by the government, up to a monthly salary cap of SEK47,750 (£3,590). After that, there's a daily statutory compensation of SEK180 (£14). Mattias took six weeks off when Otto was born and will use another nine months of parental leave from November. \"We could share the load in the beginning when everything was new,\" Mattias says. \"Those six weeks allowed us to be parents together - that made a huge difference. \"\n",

But research from 2023 showed just 12% of fathers from low-income households had access to their full entitlement of employer-enhanced parental leave and pay. Alex Lloyd-Hunter, co-founder of The Dad Shift, says \"money is the single biggest barrier\" to dads taking time off work and wants the government to fund better paternity leave for all dads. A report, published this week by the Women and Equalities Committee (WEC) said statutory pay in the UK was \"completely out of kilter with the cost of living\". It suggested the government should consider increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and paternity leave to six weeks in a phased approach.\n",

The review found many families considered it \"unnecessarily complex\". It is used in fewer than 2% of all births and a report from 2023 suggests almost half (45%) of dads were not even aware shared parental leave was an option.\n",

The Raja Ampat archipelago - a group of small islands in Indonesia's Southwest Papua Province - has been dubbed the \"Amazon of the Seas\". But mining for nickel - an ingredient in electric vehicle batteries and in stainless steel - has ramped up there in recent years, according to the organisation Global Witness. In a move that was welcomed by campaigners, the Indonesian government this week revoked permits for four out of five mining companies operating in the region.\n",

Aerial images show forest loss and sediment run-off into waters that are home to biodiverse coral reefs. Global Witness told the BBC that land use for mining, across multiple small islands in the archipelago, increased by 500 hectares - equivalent to about 700 football pitches - between 2020 and 2024.\n",

And one company that operates on Gag island, which has particularly rich deposits of nickel, has been allowed to continue its operations. The government said it would order the \"restoration of the ecological impacts that occur\" there. Coral reef conservationist and ecologist Dr Mark Erdmann told BBC News that he was \"blown away, and so happy\" about the government's decision to revoke the mining permits. \"This is the global epicenter of marine biodiversity,\" he told BBC News. Dr Erdmann has worked in Raja Ampat for more than two decades and is one of the founders of a shark rewilding project there called Reshark. He added: \"It was a voice of outrage form Indonesian people that made the government pay attention.\" But this ecological controversy is an example of how the demand for the metals needed to power battery technology - for electric cars and other low carbon energy sources - can damage the environment.\n",

It was the driving force for President Trump's recent executive order to jumpstart the mining of metallic nodules from the deep sea in international waters. It is a move that China has called illegal. Dr Erdmann pointed out that balancing economic growth with environmental protection was a particular dilemma for Indonesia. \"It has a lot of nickel - one way or the other, some of it's going to come out of the ground,\" he said. Dr Michaela Guo Ying Lo from the University of Kent led a study in 2024 of the impact of mining on local communities in Sulawesi, the large Indonesian island that has most of the country's nickel deposits. That concluded that mining activity reduced poverty slightly, but that there was significant \"worsening of environmental well-being\" including increased local water and air pollution. \"Indonesia is positioning itself globally in the nickel market,\" Dr Lo told BBC News. \"But it's important not to forget what's happening locally.\"\n",

Dr Erdmann commented: \"The nickel dilemma is a horrible one. \"Mining is always going to be environmentally impactful and we all tend to think that electrification is a good idea. But what is the acceptable damage that we're willing to see?\" The BBC contacted the Indonesian government for comment, but did not receive a reply.\n",

In short – the debts are massive, there are more older people to look after and fewer proportionately of working age to pay to support them - profound long-term problems that will pile more pressure on the bill for the nation's health and welfare bills. And few mainstream politicians would currently suggest allowing more workers from overseas to come to the UK to change that equation.\n",

But rather than panic publicly, government sources point to the rising price of oil as another reminder that they are making the right decisions at home - like planning new power stations. \"We need resilience to navigate short term crises,\" they said. \"That's what we are building.\" The source also recalled the \"Oh my God moment\" when Trump introduced the world to his surreal tariff scoreboard, saying the UK had put itself in a far better position to navigate turmoil than its predecessors.

            "The road to Dover, Delaware, is lined with barns and giant wheat fields and all the other signs of American abundance. But on this journey, the scene only highlights the devastating contrast between peace and war. We're driving here because in this rural heartland lie clues to what's behind a highly contested development thousands of miles away on the ground in Gaza. The new US- and Israeli-backed entity created to feed the territory, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), was registered here in Delaware two weeks after US President Donald Trump took office. Little is known about the group, which has been at the centre of global headlines amid scenes of chaos and deadly incidents nearly every day as desperate Palestinians have tried to reach its sites. Eyewitnesses recently reported Israeli forces firing on crowds heading to an aid site. Israel says it is investigating while also accusing Hamas of trying to sabotage the operations. The GHF said on Thursday that eight of its local Palestinian workers were killed when Hamas attacked one of their buses. And in the latest deadly incident, at least 15 Palestinians were killed on Saturday by Israeli fire, local hospitals said. The Israeli military said troops fired warning shots at a group they believed posed a potential threat, and an aircraft struck one person who moved towards them. Fifteen killed by Israeli fire near Gaza aid site, say hospitals\n",

            "On our journey in Delaware to find out more about the GHF, the search yields many clues but few definitive answers. GHF established itself saying it intended to feed civilians in Gaza, where the United Nations has said more than two million people are at risk of starvation. The foundation, which uses armed American security contractors, bypasses the UN as the main supplier of aid in Gaza. Critics see the GHF as enabling a plan by the Israeli government to displace Palestinians south into smaller areas of Gaza. But Israel - which has long sought to remove the UN as the major humanitarian provider to Palestinians - argues the alternative system was needed to stop Hamas stealing aid. Hamas denies that, while the posture of the previous US administration of President Joe Biden was that if supplies were being diverted, it was not at any scale that possibly could justify blockading aid to Gaza. In March, Israel cut off all food and other aid supplies to Gaza as it resumed its war against Hamas following a two-month ceasefire. Israel said the step, which has been widely condemned, was taken to pressure Hamas into releasing the remaining hostages. The UN and aid groups demanded access, while international condemnation of Israel grew.\n",

            "In the midst of this standoff emerged the GHF, promoted by Israel and championed by the Trump administration. But virtually nothing was known about its provenance and, crucially, who was funding it. In early May, a 14-page leaked document circulated among aid groups and journalists. It set out the concept behind GHF - to provide aid to Palestinians from several collection super-hubs in Gaza, secured by armed private contractors and ultimately, beyond their perimeter, by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The initiative appeared to be designed to bypass the UN as the major provider. Among the executives or advisers listed in the document were Nate Mook, a former boss of the charity World Central Kitchen; David Beasley, a former World Food Program chief (listed as \"to be finalized\"); and Jake Wood, a US Marine Corps veteran and disaster-response expert. It also listed a retired US lieutenant-general on its advisory board. But by phoning around those who knew some of the background, it became clear that neither Mr Mook nor Mr Beasley was in fact part of the foundation. The document appeared to be a wish list to try to build support and possibly private donations for the fund.\n",

            "Questions unanswered\n",
            "\n",
            "There were no clues as to the authorship of the leaked text, however. So who was really running the GHF? Jake Wood did indeed become the executive director, but within a fortnight he resigned saying the project breached the humanitarian principles of \"humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence\", which he said he would not abandon. In our search to find out more, we pull up in Dover's quaint downtown. A woman in costume is giving a guided history tour. This is a place you come to hear about wars past not present. We drive to the address listed in a public records search for the GHF. It's a red brick building with wooden doors and no doorbell. Inside, in a corridor, two women emerge from an office. They try to assist but say they can't help because they don't know anything specifically about GHF. The address is in fact an agent for incorporating firms - registering them legally - in Delaware, a state known for a less intrusive approach to company transparency. I ask the women why an organisation would have its registered address here, but not be based here. \"So they're not bothered,\" says one with a smile. We're back on the road, and I send some messages to the spokesman of the GHF, a newly appointed role that is being undertaken by a US-based public relations professional. I've been asking for days for an on-the-record interview with him, or the new executive director. I've asked for confirmation about who is funding GHF and who else is on the board, but nothing is forthcoming. Such an apparent lack of transparency for a humanitarian group is a \"critical\" issue, says Bill Deere, Washington DC office director for the UN's Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. His agency has been the core focus of the Israeli government's attempts to sever the relationship between the UN and Gaza's population, and it was this year banned from operating in Israel. Mr Deere says: \"For folks who like or dislike the UN and its agencies, you can always track our money. \"We're very transparent about where our funding comes from. By contrast… no-one really knows very much about this [GHF].\"\n",

            "Across the front lines\n",
            "\n",
            "He describes the new aid project as \"a Hunger Games distribution network\", a reference to a dystopian fiction saga. Mr Deere is calling for the UN to be allowed fully back into Gaza to get food aid to Palestinians again professionally, and at scale. \"I do not know, I cannot fathom, as a UN employee or even as an American, how the world can accept this situation,\" he adds. Other UN agencies and aid groups have escalated their criticism of the GHF project. They believe the GHF is breaching the fundamental humanitarian principle of independence. In other words, they argue that if aid providers working in a conflict are seen as taking a side, those workers and the aid recipients risk becoming targets. They say the GHF has militarised the aid supply, endangering civilians who also have to cross front lines to get to the distribution sites, while disadvantaging the weak and sick. For its part, Israel alleges that UNWRA is not neutral. Last year, after accusations made by Israel, the UN fired nine staff out of UNRWA's 17,000-strong workforce, saying they may have been involved in the October 7 attacks. It didn't specify what they were accused of, while UNRWA says the initial claims have still not been proven. In the Gaza war, according to the agency, at least 310 UNRWA workers have been killed, the vast majority of them by the Israeli army. I press Bill Deere, of UNRWA, on Israel and GHF's criticism, that Hamas was diverting aid under the UN system. He says Israel has never offered proof. \"This is just a made-up excuse in order to create a system that looks like it's helping people without actually helping people,\" he says. As we continue our search to find out more about GHF, I make my way to the official Delaware state building that holds company records. Our team has requested GHF's certificate of incorporation and other linked documents. A woman who works in the records office hands us three pages stapled together. They reveal only the address of the agents we've just visited, and that the GHF changed its name from the \"Global Humanitarian Fund\" to the \"Gaza Humanitarian Foundation\" on 28 April. It's signed \"Loik Henderson, President\". According to the leaked May document, Mr Henderson is a lawyer \"with decades of experience [including] Fortune 500 companies\". We try to reach him by phone, but get no response. The next day, a statement arrives from a GHF email address, which isn't attributed to any named press officer and contains no numbers to reach its media operation. It says the foundation has given out 19 lorry loads of food that day. The UN system was getting in 600 per day during the ceasefire. For a population of more than two million people, the current daily amount is clearly nowhere near enough; borne out by images of an apocalyptic scene as desperate crowds have descended from barren, sandy dunes over fences into one aid site this week. The email contains a section entitled \"inaccurate news reporting\", having earlier in the week heavily criticised media organisations for \"fabricated and exaggerated narratives\".\n",

            "The foundation has distanced itself from the series of deadly incidents, saying no-one was shot at its sites. GHF executive director John Acree is quoted in the email as saying the foundation has so far given out 8.5m meals \"without incident\". The BBC can't verify the accuracy of GHF's measure for the number of meals in each of its food boxes. Last Saturday, the GHF controversy deepened as one of the world's top consulting firms, Boston Consulting Group, said it had sacked two partners for their role in helping to set up the foundation. The chief executive apologised to staff saying the group was \"shocked and outraged\" that the two senior employees had carried out unauthorised work on the project. Israel and the Palestinians: History of the conflict explained Alex de Waal, an expert in famine and aid supply in war at Tufts University in Massachusetts, likens the concept currently being rolled out in Gaza to colonial-era counter-insurgency attempts. \"The thinking of the military as they mount operations like this is that they will be able to deny all resources to an insurgent group, forcing its members to surrender through hunger and forcing a civilian population to turn against it,\" he says. Israel strongly rejects any suggestion it uses hunger as a weapon of war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously said Israel \"must avoid famine [in Gaza], both for practical reasons and diplomatic ones\". Israel has also rejected mounting international criticism of the GHF project.\n",

            "A woman who struggled with anorexia said she had to delete TikTok to protect her health after \"skinnytok\" flooded her feed with \"damaging\" weight loss advice. If you have not heard of it, \"skinnytok\" is a controversial side of social media where people promote weight loss tips focused on restrictive eating with the aim of being \"skinny\". TikTok recently blocked the search for the term but Eve Jones, 23, from Cardiff, said, despite it being a step in the right direction, it \"scratches the surface\" on a larger issue - which people can find a way around. TikTok said it continued to restrict videos and blocked the search as it became linked to unhealthy weight loss content.\n",

            "Despite the ban, many videos promoting \"skinnytok\" which do not use the hashtag are still available on the app. As someone who has been in and out of hospital since the age of 13, Eve said the search ban was \"too late\" as the messaging was already out there.\n",
            "\n",
            "Eve has removed herself from the platform as she said users promoted \"detrimental and disordered\" eating and she was worried about the impact it was having on younger people. \"It's almost a compulsion to watch it. There is a self-damaging part of eating disorders where you try to access this,\" Eve said. \"Once you interact with one post like that, your feed is flooded with it so quickly.\" Letter accents and numbers can also be used to disguise damaging hashtags, Eve said, so content was still \"very easy\" to access. \"I'm lucky to be in a position where I have had my treatment and I know how to avoid my triggers, but people on the other side of this won't be aware of that.\"\n",

Other controversial quotes include: \"You're not a dog, you don't deserve a treat.\" Eve said she blocked certain words from her social media feeds, including TikTok and X, but the videos still appeared. Many users insist people should avoid consuming the content if it is harmful, Eve said, or come off social media, but she argues it was not that simple. \"Anyone who is actively searching 'skinnytok' is either not going to recognise what they are doing is unhealthy, or they are not going to seek help about it,\" she said. The word skinny has become a buzz word online, Eve said, with many promoting extreme weight loss under the guise of having \"healthy\" self control and willpower. \"There is a lot of denial in having an eating disorder,\" Eve said, adding that people often were not aware the content was damaging. Her anorexia spiralled from clean eating she believed was healthy.\n",

            "The government has written to Sainsbury's and Morrisons asking them to stop \"advertising and promoting\" heated tobacco products, which it says is against the law. The BBC reported in February the supermarkets were displaying posters and video screens showing devices which create a nicotine-containing vapour by heating tobacco with an electric current. At the time, both supermarkets said they believed the adverts were legal. In response to the letter, Sainsbury's said it was in \"close contact with the government\", while Morrisons said it would reply \"in due course\".\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2002, the Labour government under Tony Blair passed a law banning tobacco advertising. It defined a tobacco product as something designed to be \"smoked, sniffed, sucked or chewed\". Morrisons has argued that this means that it doesn't apply to heated tobacco products, as they don't produce smoke. Advertising for Philip Morris International's (PMI) iQos heated tobacco device on posters and video screens was still on display in Sainsbury's and Morrisons stores visited by the BBC in June, where they were visible to children. PMI said it believes the Department of Health's interpretation of the law is wrong, and said it has \"complied with all applicable laws and regulations\" since it launched iQos in 2016. The government has now written to the supermarkets clarifying that in its opinion, the law does apply to these products. A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson told the BBC: \"In May, we wrote to supermarkets reiterating that the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act 2002… applies to all tobacco products currently on the market, and formally requested they stop advertising and promoting heated tobacco products in stores. \"All tobacco products are harmful to health,\" the spokesperson added.\n",

What if my niece's remains have not even been found? The wait is killing us,\" he said. Officials have refused to comment on Mr Jignesh's claim, but a fire department officer and a police official told the BBC on the condition of anonymity that a search for remains of the passengers is still under way. Rajnish Patel, additional superintendent of the Civil Hospital, said on Saturday that 11 victims had been identified so far based on their DNA samples, adding that their families had been informed.\n",

Only one of the 242 passengers and crew on board survived. At least eight others were killed as the plane struck the hostel of a medical college when it came down on a densely populated residential area near the airport. Things have moved swiftly since. The Indian government has ordered a high-level investigation into the incident and has ordered all Boeing 787s operated by local carriers to be inspected. While the reason of the crash remains unknown, the country's aviation authority has said it is looking into all possible causes for the accident, also bringing in foreign aviation experts to assist with the inquiry.

Officials have talked about how the process of identifying bodies has been extremely challenging - and is being carried out in small batches - as most of the remains have been charred beyond recognition. \"There is no scope for mistakes here - we have to ensure that every family receives the right body,\" said HP Sanghvi, the director of Directorate of Forensic Sciences in Gandhinagar city. \"But DNA identification is a time-consuming process. Besides, given the scale of the disaster, there is also a possibility that the DNA of several passengers was damaged due to the extremely high temperature of the blast.\" Jaishankar Pillai, a forensic dentist at the hospital, told reporters that his team has been trying to collect dental records from charred bodies, as that might be the only source of DNA left.\n",

So far, four wards - including the hostel canteen, the site of the crash - have been completely emptied out. But students living in other nearby wings of the hostel have also begun to leave. \"In one of the wards, there are just three people left - everyone else has gone back to their homes for now. They will leave soon too, but until then, they are sitting there, all alone, haunted by the memory of what has happened,\" their friend, who is also a student at the college and wanted to stay anonymous, said. But between the college and hospital - in the vast expanse of this city of more than seven million people - there are many others who also are reeling from the tragedy. The last Kartik Kalawadia heard of his brother Mahesh was on Thursday, some 30 minutes before the crash. It was a phone call Mahesh made to his wife: \"I am coming home,\" he said to her. She never heard from him again. A music producer in the Gujarati film industry, Mahesh had been on his way back home from work that day and was crossing the area when the plane hurtled down and crashed into the buildings. Mr Kalawadia told the BBC that his brother's last location before his phone became unreachable was just a few hundred metres away from BJ Medical college. The family has since filed a police complaint and has made countless visits to the Civil Hospital. They have found nothing so far. \"The hospital told us they have no record of my brother. We also tried tracing his scooter, but nothing came of that either,\" Mr Kalawadia said. \"It's like he vanished into thin air.\"\n",

It is inside the Israeli military's Netzarim Corridor. The Israeli military said troops fired warning shots at a group they believed posed a potential threat.

Large numbers of Palestinians appear to be staying near the aid distribution sites - one in the Netzarim Corridor and three others further south - so that they will be ready to get hold of food parcels when and if they are opened. In another incident on Saturday, al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City said 12 people were killed by Israeli fire as they waited for a convoy of aid lorries on the coastal road.

Two years later his future has been transformed thanks to his kidney donor - his 63-year-old dad Brian. \"This has 100% made our bond stronger, I feel forever like I owe him,\" said Kieran. \"Everything I'm able to do now is because of him and I have no worries any more.\"\n",

In St John's Hospital in Livingston the following day, he was told his blood pressure was \"through the roof\". Six weeks later, medics said his kidneys were failing.

            "\n",
            "In a sign of Greenland's growing importance, French President Emmanuel Macron is visiting the Arctic island today, in what experts say is a show of European unity and a signal to Donald Trump. Stepping foot in the capital Nuuk this morning, Macron will be met with chilly and blustery weather, but despite the cold conditions, he'll be greeted warmly. \"This is big, I must say, because we never had visits from a president at all, and it's very welcomed,\" says veteran Greenlandic official, Kaj Kleist. Nuuk is a small city of less than 20,000 people, and the arrival of a world leader and his entourage, is a major event. \"I think that people will be curious, just hearing about it,\" says consultant and podcast host Arnakkuluk Jo Kleist. \"I think they'll be interested in, what his message is going to be.\" \"He's the president of France, but he's also an important representative of Europe. It's a message from the European countries that they're showing support, that Greenland is not for sale, and for the Kingdom of Denmark,\" says Arnakkuluk Jo Kleist. \"These last months have created some questions about what allies we need, and also about what allies do we need to strengthen cooperation with,\" she says.\n",
            "\n",
            "France's president is the first high-profile leader to be invited by Greenland's new prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen. Talks will focus on North Atlantic and Arctic security as well as climate change, economic development and critical minerals, before Macron continues to the G7 summit in Canada. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen is also attending, and called the French president's visit \"another concrete testimony of European unity\" amid a \"difficult foreign policy situation in recent months\".\n",

            "For several months Greenland, which is a semi-autonomous Danish territory with 56,000 people, has come under intense pressure as US President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he wants to acquire the vast mineral-rich island, citing American security as the primary reason and not ruling out using force. \"Macron is not coming to Greenland just for Greenland's sake, it's also part of a bigger game, among these big powers in the world,\" says Kleist.\n",
            "\n",
            "France was among the first nations to speak up against Mr Trump, even floating an offer of deploying troops, which Denmark declined. Only a few days ago at the UN's Oceans conference in Nice, Macron stressed that \"the ocean is not for sale, Greenland is not for sale, the Arctic and no other seas are for sale\" - words which were swiftly welcomed by Nielsen. \"France has supported us since the first statements about taking our country came out,\" he wrote in a Facebook post. \"It is both necessary and gratifying.\" That Macron is coming is a strong message itself, reckons Ulrik Pram Gad, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies. \"The vice presidential couple weren't really able to pull it off,\" he says, referring to JD Vance and his wife Usha's scaled-back trip in March and lack of public engagements. \"That, of course, sends a message to the American public, and to Trump.\"\n",

            "It also highlights a shift, as Greenland's leaders consolidate relations with Denmark and the EU, \"because we have to have allies in these problems,\" says Kaj Kleist, alluding to US pressure. \"I think it's a good time for Macron to come through here,\" Kleist adds. \"They can talk about defence of the Arctic before the big NATO meetings… And hear what we are looking for, in terms of cooperation and investment.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "However, opposition leader Pele Broberg thinks Greenland should have hosted bilateral talks with France alone. \"\"We welcome any world leader, anytime,\" he says \"Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like a visit for Greenland this time. It looks like a visit for Denmark.\" Relations between the US and Denmark have grown increasingly fractious. US Vice President JD Vance scolded the Nordic country for underinvesting in the territory's security during his recent trip to an American military base in the far north of Greenland. Last month Denmark's foreign minister summoned the US ambassador in Copenhagen, following a report in the Wall Street Journal alleging that US spy agencies were told to focus efforts on Greenland. Then, at a congressional hearing on Thursday, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth appeared to suggest under tense questioning that the Pentagon had prepared \"contingency\" plans for taking Greenland by force \"if necessary\".\n",
            "\n",
            "Denmark, however, has treaded cautiously. Last week its parliament green-lighted a controversial bill allowing US troops to be stationed on Danish soil, and is spending another $1.5bn (£1.1bn) to boost Greenland's defence. That heightened military presence was on show this weekend as a Danish naval frigate sailed around Nuuk Fjord and helicopters circled over the town. \"Denmark has been reluctant to make this shift from having a very transatlantic security strategy to a more European strategy,\" assesses Gad, but that's changed in recent months.\n",
            "\n",
            "With rising tensions and increased competition between global powers in the Arctic, the EU is also stepping up its role.

            "Content: Rory McIlroy says he has \"earned the right to do whatever I want to do\" after skipping media interviews following his opening two rounds of what he called a \"pretty average\" US Open performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Masters champion spoke to the media for the first time since the tournament started after Saturday's four-over 74 pushed him back to 10 over par after three rounds.\n",
            "\n",
            "McIlroy said he hoped Sunday's final round will be a case of taking \"four and a half hours and out of here\" to put a disappointing week behind him.\n",
            "\n",
            "The 36-year-old has cut a frustrated figure throughout the tournament at Oakmont, only just making the halfway cut on Friday.\n",
            "\n",
            "And, after Saturday's round, he said making himself less available to some sections of the media is partly due to a leaked story surrounding his driver before last month's US PGA Championship.\n",
            "\n",
            "It emerged the United States Golf Association (USGA) instructed McIlroy to change the club just two days before the event after an equipment inspection deemed it 'non-conforming'.\n",
            "\n",
            "There was no suggestion that McIlroy had done anything wrong with regards to his driver and he is not contractually obliged to speak to the media at events.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"It's just frustration with you guys [some sections of the media],\" the Northern Irishman said in his first post-round interview at a major since winning the Masters at Augusta in April.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"I have been totally available for the past number of years,\" McIlroy added. \"That [driver issue] was a part of it but at Augusta I skipped you guys on Thursday. It's not out of the ordinary as I've done it before, but I am doing it a little more often. I feel like I've earned the right to do whatever I want to do.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "The Oakmont course has proved to be a challenge for the entire field and, although McIlroy has been happy with some aspects of his game, retaining focus has been an issue at times.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"The name of the game this week is staying patient and I've tried to do a good job of it out there, but it's just one of those golf courses where you can lose patience pretty quickly,\" he said.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"I have driven the ball as good for a long time, so that's a positive from this week. I was hoping to play better, but didn't.\"\n",
